                queen bed.SROs are a form of affordable housing, in some cases for formerly or otherwise homeless
                individuals.[4] SRO units are the least expensive form of non-subsidized rental housing, with median
                rents even in New York City ranging from $450 to $705 per month in 2013.[5] The term is primarily used
                in Canada and US.</p>
            <h4>family Room</h4>
            <p> a quad room is set up for four people to stay comfortably. This means the room will have two double
                beds. Some, however, may be set up dormitory-style with bunks or twins, so check with the property to
                make sure.In San Francisco, Starcity is converting unused parking garages, commercial spaces and offices
                into single-room residential units, where tenants (tech professionals are the typical renter) get a
                furnished bedroom and access to wifi, janitor services and common kitchens and lounges for $1,400 to
                $2,400 per month, an approach that has been called "dorm living for grownups".[</p>
